      <p>In the time it takes to order takeout, you can enjoy a home-cooked meal that's healthier, less expensive, and delicious. Even if a recipe isn't specially marked as easy, you can look for signs that point in that direction. Generally, recipes with 7 or fewer ingredients can be considered easy. And recipes that have only two or three instruction steps won't bog you down.</p>
