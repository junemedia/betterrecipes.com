== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about styling? =

There's really only a minimum of styling included "out-of-the-box". You can style the tabs by adding your own stylesheet and images in your theme directory. Like so:

1. Create a directory called "tabbed-sidebar-widgets" in your theme's root folder. (eg: /wp-content/themes/mytheme/tabbed-sidebar-widgets)
2. Add a css file named "widget.css" to the above directory and style away!

There's no graphic style editor at this moment. 

== Screenshots ==
