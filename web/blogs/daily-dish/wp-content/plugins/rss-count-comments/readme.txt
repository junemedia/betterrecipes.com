This is a simple plugin that shows the number of comments in the RSS after Posts' Titles (similar to TextPattern).

Installation is extremely easy:

1. Upload 'rss-count-comments' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's all! Easy, eh?


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Only the Post's title.
